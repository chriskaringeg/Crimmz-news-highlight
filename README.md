## CRIMMZ-NEWS-APP

Built By KARINGE KINYUA

## Description

News app is a web application that displays a list of various news sources. On choosing a news source, it will preview the top news articles of the day. Clicking a news article will redirect the user to read it fully from the news source. It achieves this by using the [News API].
